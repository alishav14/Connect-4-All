This project is an interactive game of Connect 4. It supports standard operations 
  such as players adding their individual tokens represented by 'R' for the red player and 
  'B' for the blue player. In the terminal interface, the game signals a win if one 
  player gets 4 of their tokens in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally 
  or a draw if every column and row is full. With various player modes (as selected
  by the user), statistics of the game rounds presented, and player score tracking, 
  Connect 4 All is taken to a new level with a more engaging and creative user interface.
